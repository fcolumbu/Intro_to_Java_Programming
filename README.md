# Intro_to_Java_Programming
The purpose of this repository is to act as a convenient share between my devices that will track changes. QNAP qSYNC does not track changes.

Consistent with my comments from the Interactive Python Class:
Feel free to use this code for your own learning if you get stuck on a project. Perhaps, my code might be useful to give you clues to help you fix your project, but please do not use it to cheat.

After all, what would be the point of a simple copy / paste?

What would you learn?

The programming environment for this class is a combination of Udacity's on-line IDE and BlueJ, 
a downloadable open source free instructional IDE.
